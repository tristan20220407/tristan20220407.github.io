                  <p>Across the board, advertisers are complaining about rising ad costs and plummeting ROAS.</p>
                  <p>Along with limited audience targeting, added friction to opt-ins and delayed performance tracking...</p>
                  <p>It’s no wonder many advertisers claim the platform is no longer the advertiser’s paradise it used to be.</p>
                  <p>Yet, a small group of advertisers are still succeeding with ads that generate 2-5X ROAS - consistently.</p>
                  <p>While their competition is quitting Facebook in masses, they are able to dominate their market with just a handful of ads.</p>

                  <p class="mb-0">The reason more than 9 million businesses now advertise on the platform is in<br class="d-none d-lg-block"><span></span> large part because of what we call “Facebook Money Math”...</p>
                  <h3 class="content-title">THE PREDICTABILITY OF<br class="d-block d-sm-none"><span></span> SPENDING $1 AND MAKING $2</h3>
                  <p>That’s a 2X ROAS (return on ad spend) or a 200% return on your initial investment.</p>
                  <p>Today even the most beginner advertisers can launch new campaigns that allow them to consistently spend $1 and make $2… Or spend $1 and make $3, $4, or even $5!</p>
                  <p>If right now you could invest $1 into a Facebook ad and make $2, what business owner wouldn’t do that math again and again until they simply couldn’t anymore?</p>
                  <p>Or even if you could invest $1 and get back that same $1 (so you breakeven) BUT...you also got a new customer. Who wouldn’t still do that deal? Essentially free customers?!</p>
                  <p><strong>That’s why it might be the most profitable business building skill in our digital age.</strong></p>
                  <p>And it’s typically the #1 investment every business that’s winning online right now is making every single month.</p>
                  <p>Which is why you see everyone from bootstrapped entrepreneurs launching businesses from their bedrooms, to Silicon Valley startups and the biggest most cash-rich brands in the world…</p>
                  <p><strong>All advertising on Facebook.</strong></p>
                  <p>Because all hype aside…</p>
                  <p>Actual fortunes are being made faster using Facebook ads right now than possibly any other marketing medium in history. With some hard work and the right knowledge, it can legitimately be the quickest way to making life changing profits online.</p>
                  <p><strong>But the ugly truth many “gurus” try to hide from you?</strong></p>
                  <p>It can also be the fastest way in history to waste money. If you’ve ever tried to run your own ads, you know it’s not always the “ATM machine” many guru’s make it out to be.</p>

                        <div class="about-content-wrapper">
                           <p>His agency currently manages $10,000,000 a month in ad spend for 150+ different brands across all niches and industries.</p>
                           <p>From Apple and Snow Teeth Whitening, to Vessi Footwear and Step Banking, Nick has been trusted by businesses to help them grow in ways they didn’t know were even possible.</p>
                           <p>Using the exact ad strategy you’ll learn inside this course...</p>
                           <p>He helped PupSocks launch as a new business and do $13,000,000 in just 32 days...</p>
                           <p>And helped Diff Eyewear launch as a new business and do $255,000 in less than 24 hours!</p>
                           <p>Back in 2015 Shackelford was just ending his career as a professional soccer player for the LA Galaxy II. He was in debt and needed money. While coaching high school soccer he soon realized “trading time for money” wasn’t going to help him fulfill his goals.</p>
                           <p>So like any self-made entrepreneur, he decided to invest in himself and develop a skill set that could alter his financial future forever.</p>
                           <p>After working on Apple’s team to help them get new customers for its iPhone 7, iPad Pro, and Apple Watch...</p>
                           <p>Shackelford started his own fidget spinner business called Fidgetly which went viral throughout the world. Yes, he’s widely known as the person who helped popularize the fidget spinner!</p>
                           <p>After the close of Fidgetly, Shackelford launched Structured Social to start helping other brands scale online by using Facebook ads the right way.</p>
                           <p>Today he sits atop a short list of the best Facebook marketers on the planet.</p>
                           <p>When it comes to running Facebook ads for all kinds of different businesses and budgets, there’s simply no one better to learn from.</p>

                  <p>If you’ve ever hired an agency to run your ads then you know they're not cheap. Especially not if you want the very best like Nick and his team at Structured Social to run them for you.</p>
                  <p>But you know what’s even more costly than that help? The cost of wasted time and opportunity when someone runs your ads but can’t deliver the results they promised.</p>
                  <p>That’s why instead of spending a fortune to hire someone or risk wasting your time on someone that doesn’t work…</p>
                  <p>Our suggestion for most founders is to <strong>first learn how to run your Facebook ads yourself!</strong></p>
                  <p>Is the goal for you to run your own ads 100% of the time? For most of you it’s likely not.</p>
                  <p>Instead the goal is to put profits before payroll. To trade your time (running the ads) for money, until it makes sense financially not to. Then you can trade your money for someone else's time.</p>
                  <p>But the ability to run your own ads is like having the <strong>ultimate business building insurance.</strong></p>
                  <p>And once your ads are winning and you’re bringing in consistent new revenue, you can even just use this course as a “playbook” to train one of your team members and have them run the ads for you.</p>
                  <p>So instead of paying $10,000 to have some “guru” coach you...</p>
                  <p>$5,000 a month for someone else to run your ads…</p>
                  <p>Or even $2,500 to attend an event that contains just a fraction of what’s in this course...</p>
                  <p>For just $997 or less than <strong>$2.73 a day</strong> (less than a cup of coffee)...</p>
                  <p>You’ll get instant access to the entire How To Run Facebook Ads Course where you’ll learn how to bring in new leads and customers at profit every single day!</p>
                  <p>It’s the exact step-by-step blueprint Nick has used to help more than $150+ different businesses succeed with Facebook ads while profitably spending $100M+ on ads alone.</p>

They teach outdated tactics and short term “fixes” which might work today but don’t tomorrow when a new Facebook policy change hits.</p>
                              <p>“How To Run Facebook Ads 1.0” is taught by a serial entrepreneur and someone who’s recognized as one of the best Facebook marketers in the world.</p>
                              <p>Nick Shackelford’s algorithm-proof process has already worked for over 150 different businesses and helped him to profitably spend more than $100M on Facebook ads in the last few years alone!</p>

It’s been proven to work for everything from ecommerce and high-ticket services, to software and digital products.</p>
                              <p>If for some reason you follow the steps laid out inside and it doesn’t help you run more profitable ads, you’re always protected by Foundr’s 365-day money back guarantee.</p>

                              <p>No. While Nick has an unbelievable track record of success with ecommerce ads, this course is for all kinds of businesses, products, and offerings.</p>
                              <p>We actually chose Nick because of his ecommerce background. Ecommerce typically deals with razor thin margins and if you can create successful ads there, you can create successful ads in any other industry!</p>

                              <p>While the point of purchase or length of sale might be different in B2B, the process of finding new leads and sales using engaging Facebook ads is the same.</p>

                              <p>But for those who don’t have a team, this ad creation process can be done completely by yourself without any problems at all.
